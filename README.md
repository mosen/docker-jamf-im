docker-jamf-im
==============

A Dockerfile for building a [JAMF Infrastructure Manager](http://docs.jamfsoftware.com/9.93/casper-suite/administrator-guide/Infrastructure_Manager_Instances.html) container.

How To Use The Container:
-----
1.	You need to obtain these things on your own, due to EULA agreements.  This is why I cannot distribute this as a Docker image:

- The JAMF Infrastructure Manager .deb package: 
	This can be found in your [JamfNation software assets](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/login.html) section. Place the ".deb" file in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
